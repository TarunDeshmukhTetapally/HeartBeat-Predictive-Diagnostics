# HeartBeat: Advanced Machine Learning for Predictive Heart Disease Diagnosis

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The models are built using Python and Jupyter Notebooks and evaluated on their ability to predict the occurrence based on various health indicators.

## Dataset
The project uses the `heart.csv` dataset which contains key cardiovascular health indicators.

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

## Installation
Instructions on how to install and run the project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn keras tensorflow`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook main.ipynb`

## Files Description
- `main.ipynb` — Contains all the coding and model development.
- `heart.csv` — Dataset used for training the models.
- `project.docx` — Project report and documentation.

## Running the Project
To run this project, ensure that you have Jupyter installed and execute `main.ipynb`. Detailed steps can be found under the Installation section.
